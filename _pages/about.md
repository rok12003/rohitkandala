I'm currently a [Data Scientist at Harmony Labs](https://harmonylabs.org), and am passionate about the how we can use data to better understand, and ultimately, better help people. 

This has led me to explore survey research, data science, social science, machine learning, and so much more. However, all of this is in service to better understanding how people think and feel about things. I'm just someone who listens for a living. 

Before Harmony Labs, I worked on political campaigns, most notably Kamala Harris' 2024 Presidential Campaign, and am a recent graduate of [UChicago's CAPP program.](https://capp.uchicago.edu/)
