I'm currently a [Data Scientist at Harmony Labs](https://harmonylabs.org/team/rohit-kandala), and am passionate about how we can use data to better understand, and ultimately, better help people. 

In short, I listen to people for a living.

This has led me to explore survey research, data science, social science, and machine learning to name a few areas. However, all of this is in service to better understand how people think and feel about things. 

Before Harmony Labs, I worked on political campaigns, most notably The Harris/Walz 2024 Presidential Campaign, and am a recent graduate of [UChicago's CAPP program.](https://capp.uchicago.edu/)
