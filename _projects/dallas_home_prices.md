I was curious whether I could reasonably predict single-family home prices in the Dallas MSA, and used RShiny to display this work. TL;DR -- sort of! I do think this is a severe case of overfitting.

[Check out my app here.](https://rohitkandala.shinyapps.io/interactive_map/) This RShiny dashboard allows users to explore how different factors (location, size, age) influence home prices across the Dallas metro area.

The most fun I had with this project was actually the write-up and making some economic data gifs. This is available in the README. 

I've already listed some things I would've done differently, but a great learning experience nonetheless!
