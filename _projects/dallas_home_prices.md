title: "Dallas Real Estate Tool"

I was curious whether I reasonably predict single-family home prices in the Dallas MSA, and use RShiny to do so. 

[Check out my app here.](https://rohitkandala.shinyapps.io/interactive_map/) The most fun I had with this project was actually the write-up and making some economic data gifs. 

I've already listed some things I would've done differently, but a great learning experience nonetheless!
