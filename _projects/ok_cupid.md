title: "OKCupid Profiles"

On Kaggle, there's a great [OKCupid dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles)
with ~60K rows. This is a great opportunity to learn about transformers, and that's exactly what my group did. 

We trained & fine-tuned models on OkCupid data to find optimal "matches" through user input. One of our teammates even made a Flask app!

I led a lot of the EDA on this project, and dating app data is always...interesting! This led me to experiment with a "toxicity" filter with our transformer model that worked surprisingly well.
