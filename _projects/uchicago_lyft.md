title: "UChicago Lyft Ride Smart Program"
---

My team used the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips-2018-2022-/m6dm-c72p/about_data) to analyze how the UChicago Lyft Ride Smart pass affected ridesharing in Hyde Park.

This was a fun project where I served as the person aggregating & organizing a lot of the analyses.
