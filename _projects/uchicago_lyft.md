title: "UChicago Lyft Ride Smart Program"

My team used the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips-2018-2022-/m6dm-c72p/about_data) to analyze how the UChicago Lyft Ride Smart pass affected ridesharing in Hyde Park.

This was a fun project where I served as the person aggregating & organizing a lot of the analyses. We found interesting patterns in how the program changed transportation behavior in the neighborhood quite dramatically -- which provided insights that could inform future university transportation policies.
