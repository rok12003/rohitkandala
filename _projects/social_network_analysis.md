title: "CEO Affiliation Networks"
---

Social Network Analysis was a fascinating class, and my team was inspired by [Joseph Galaskiewicz's 1985 paper on the link between CEOs and philanthropy.](http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/41810/1/8.Joseph%20Galaskiewicz.pdf)

This project analyzed Galaskiewicz's work, and we also replicated this network with modern-day business leaders around the Twin Cities region.  

Looking back, I think the data collection for our replication could be much improved, but the original study was eye-opening and informative. We found high BLAU scores all around suggesting an important relationship between philanthropy and business.
